# Crystal Game

The crystal core is overloading! Use the gems to syphon power from it until it stabilizes. Be care not to overdraw the energy! If the power level drops below 0, the crystal core will be unsalvageable.

## Getting Started

Open up the [project link](https://robertshaw87.github.io/Crystal-Game/) and you should be able to see the example webpage shown below:

![Crystal Game](assets/images/readme-game.png "Crystal Game")

Simply click one of the gems to reduce the power of the crystal. Your goal is to reduce the crystal to 0 power without letting it fall into the negatives. Beware! The gems will syphon a random amount of power each time you reset!

## Built With

* Html

* CSS

* [Javascript](https://www.javascript.com/) - The scripting Language used

* [BootstrapCDN v4.1.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) - The web framework used

## Challenges

While I didn't have much trouble with the logic and dynamic generation during the creation of this app, I did find a few hiccups in styling. I layered too many animations on top of each other and the end result is jumpy and twitchy instead of smooth. I am quite satisfied with the actual feel of the page though.
